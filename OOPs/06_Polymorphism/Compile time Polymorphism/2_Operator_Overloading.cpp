/*
ðŸ”¹ Operator Overloading in C++

Operator overloading allows you to define custom behavior for operators (like +, -, *) when used with your own classes.

ðŸš« Operators that **cannot** be overloaded:
- Scope Resolution Operator (::)
- Sizeof Operator (sizeof)
- Conditional Operator (?:)

ðŸ”¹ Scope Resolution Operator (::)
- Used to access a variable, function, or class defined in a specific scope.
- Helps in distinguishing between local and global scope or between base and derived class members.
