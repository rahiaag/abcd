‚úî A Dangling Pointer is a pointer that points to deleted memory, causing undefined behavior.

üìå When Does the Dangling Pointer Problem Occur?
1Ô∏è‚É£ Shallow Copy (Yes, Can Cause Dangling Pointers)
Since shallow copy copies the pointer, not the data, if one object deletes the memory, the other object is left with a dangling pointer.
This is a major issue when working with dynamically allocated memory.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Deleting a Pointer (Without Shallow Copy)
Even without shallow copy, if a pointer is deleted but still accessed, it causes a dangling pointer.

Example: Simple Dangling Pointer

int* ptr = new int(10);
delete ptr;  // Memory is freed
cout << *ptr;  // ‚ùå Dangling pointer (undefined behavior)
